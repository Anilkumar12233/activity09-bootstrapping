Activity 09 - Bootstrapping
================

This activity is intended to be completed in one week - outside of class
preparation work and one class meetings. On our Blackboard course site
you were provided with items to read, watch, and do prior to attempting
this activity. Do not proceed in this activity until you have minimally:

1.  Read *ISL* [Section
    5.2](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf). The
    previous link will take you to an online full text pdf from the
    author‚Äôs site. Use the table of contents to quickly navigate the
    file.

In this repository/directory, you should see five items:

- `README-img` - a folder containing images that I am embedding within
  this `README.md` file and other files. You do not need to do anything
  with this.
- `.gitignore` - a file that is used to specify what Git can ignore when
  pushing to GitHub. You do not need to do anything with this.
- `README.md` - the document you are currently reading.
- `bootstrapping` - a folder that contains items for you to complete
  during the class meeting.

Now, you will make your own copy of this repository.

## Task 1: Forking & cloning

### Forking

Read these directions first, then work through them. In this GitHub repo
(i.e., my repo):

1.  Click on the ![fork](README-img/fork-icon.png) **Fork** icon near
    the upper-right-hand corner. You will be taken to a **Create a new
    fork** screen.
2.  Verify that your GitHub username is selected under **Owner** and
    that the **Repository name** is `activity09-bootstrapping` with a
    green check mark (this verifies that you do not already have a
    GitHub repository with this name).
3.  You may provide a **Description** if you would like. This is a way
    to provide some additional, more descriptive, meta information
    related to the things you did. I like to provide a brief description
    of what happened.
4.  Verify that **Copy the `main` branch only** is selected.
5.  Click on the green **Create fork** button at the bottom of this
    page.

You should be taken a copy of this repo that is in your GitHub account.
That is, your page title should be `username/activity09-bootstrapping`,
where `username` is replaced with your GitHub username. Directly below
this, you will see the following message:

> forked from
> [gvsu-sta631/activity09-bootstrapping](https://github.com/gvsu-sta631/activity09-bootstrapping)

You will complete the rest of this activity in **your** forked copy of
the `activity09-bootstrapping` repo.

### Cloning

Read these directions first, then work through them. Note that you will
be switching between RStudio and your GitHub repo (that you previously
forked).

1.  In RStudio, click on the
    <img src="README-img/rproj-icon.png" alt="RStudio Project" width = "20"/>
    icon (the icon below the Edit drop-down menu).
2.  Click on **Version Control** on the *New Project Wizard* pop-up.
3.  Click on **Git** and you should be on a ‚ÄúClone Git Repository‚Äù page.
4.  Back to **your** `activity09-bootstrapping` GitHub repo, click on
    the green **Code** button near the top of the page.
5.  Verify that **HTTPS** is underlined in orange/red on the drop-down
    menu, then copy the URL provided.
6.  Back in RStudio, paste the URL in the ‚ÄúRepository URL‚Äù text field.
7.  The ‚ÄúProject directory name‚Äù text field should have automatically
    populated with `activity09-bootstrapping`. If yours did not (this is
    usually an issue on Macs),
    - Click back into the ‚ÄúRepository URL‚Äù text field.
    - Highlight any bit of this text (it does not seem to matter what or
      how much).
    - Press Ctrl/Cmd and the ‚ÄúProject directory name‚Äù should now have
      automatically populated with `activity09-bootstrapping`.
8.  Browse to `STA 631/Activities` (assuming you followed my opinionated
    file structure from earlier in the semester), then click **Choose**.
9.  Click on **Create Project**.

Your screen should refresh and the **Files** pane should say that you
are currently in your `activity09-bootstrapping` folder that currently
has the same files and folders as your GitHub repo. If you are asked for
your GitHub credentials, provide your GitHub username and your PAT (not
your password).

![check-in](README-img/noun-magnifying-glass.png) **Check in**

Take a moment to reflect on what is possibly your second time doing this
forking process.

- Look back at what you said in Activity 2 (SLR) - hopefully, you wrote
  this down. What advice would you (now) give past (Week 2-3) you?

## Task 2: Boostrapping

Read these directions first, then work through them.

1.  In your `activity09-bootstrapping` repo folder/directory, locate and
    click into the `bootstrapping` subfolder.
2.  In the `bootstrapping` subfolder, you will be greeted by a new
    `README.md` file. Do your best to complete the tasks/directions
    provide in this subfolder by **11:59 pm (EST) today**.
3.  Ask questions in class as you are working. If you need to finish
    this up outside of our class meetings, remember that you can use our
    Teams workspace (linked on Blackboard), and post questions/issues in
    the **Muddy** channel. If someone else already posted what you
    though was muddy, add any clarification to their post and give them
    a ‚Äú+ 1‚Äù üëç. Remember that this space is for conversations as well as
    posting questions. Read through your peers‚Äô muddy posts and do your
    best to provide help.

The rest of this `README` document contains tasks/directions for the
second class meeting of this week.
